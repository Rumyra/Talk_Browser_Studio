## About

What does creating mean? To have an idea? To build something physical? To draw a picture or make a sound?

What has creation come to mean in the digital world, where code is an accepted tool and a computer is an acceptable platform. Modern browsers give us an alluring environment in which to create and build and make to our hearts content.

Is this creative coding? What does that mean? Are we creating or generating? Were we doing that before the accessibility of code. Can everyone do this?

This talk demonstrates this emergence using the browser to illustrate the development of, well, development. Has code replaced more traditional ways to create? Or has it just complimented it?

## Slides

I don't upload my slides due to some problems I've had with copyright infringement (As in people taking my slides ðŸ˜¢).

However, you can find all the slides within the talk in the [index file](https://github.com/Rumyra/Talk-Web-Audio/blob/master/views/index.html) within this build. It's just an HTML file so pretty easy to navigate - all my slide notes are there as well, within the markup.

For each conference I branch, so just choose the correct branch for the correct index (no two talks are the same).
